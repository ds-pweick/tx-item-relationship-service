Feature: IRS support for different aspect models

  Background:
    Given the IRS URL "https://irs.dev.demo.catena-x.net"
    And the admin user api key

  Scenario: BomLifecycle 'asBuilt' for testing "JustInSequencePart-Model [BPNL00000000BJTL]
    Given I register an IRS job for globalAssetId "urn:uuid:57be2fd7-501e-4fea-9f3b-a6c746c3579d" and BPN "BPNL00000000BJTL"
    And collectAspects "true"
    And depth 10
    And direction "downward"
    And bomLifecycle "asBuilt"
    And aspects :
      | urn:samm:io.catenax.just_in_sequence_part:3.0.0#JustInSequencePart |
    When I get the job-id
    Then I check, if the job has status "COMPLETED" within 20 minutes
    And I check, if "submodels" are equal to "TRI-1537-expected-submodels.json"

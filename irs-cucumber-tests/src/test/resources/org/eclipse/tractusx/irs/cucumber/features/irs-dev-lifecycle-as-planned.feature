Feature: BomLifecycle 'asPlanned' implementation

  Background:
    Given the IRS URL "https://irs.dev.demo.catena-x.net"
    And the admin user api key


  @DEV @INTEGRATION_TEST
  @TRI-893 @TRI-1941 @TRI-1942 @TRI-873 @TRI-1843 @TRI-1770
  Scenario: End 2 End for BomLifecycle 'asPlanned' Vehicle Model C for SAP [BPNL00000003AZQP]
    Given I register an IRS job for globalAssetId "urn:uuid:65e1554e-e5cd-4560-bac1-1352582122fb" and BPN "BPNL00000003AZQP"
    And collectAspects "true"
    And depth 10
    And direction "downward"
    And bomLifecycle "asPlanned"
    And aspects :
      | urn:samm:io.catenax.part_as_planned:2.0.0#PartAsPlanned |
    When I get the job-id
    Then I check, if the job has status "COMPLETED" within 20 minutes
    And I check, if "relationships" are equal to "TRI-893-expected-relationships.json"
    And I check, if "submodels" are equal to "TRI-893-expected-submodels.json"
